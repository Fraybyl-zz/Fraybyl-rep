# Frequent inserts, updates, and deletes can cause the database file to become fragmented - where data for a single table or index is scattered around the database file.
# Running VACUUM ensures that each table and index is largely stored contiguously within the database file.
# In some cases, VACUUM may also reduce the number of partially filled pages in the database, reducing the size of the database file further.
# SQLite3 binary in /system/xbin is required!
